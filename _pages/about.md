Hi! I'm Aditya.

I'm a Machine Learning Data Scientist at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://corporate.thermofisher.com/content/tfcorpsite/us/en/index/about.html) where I focus on B2B recommender systems. Previously, I graduated with highest distinction in Information Systems from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I have a broad range of interests ranging from evaluation of ML in production, scaleable use cases of intelligent system and natural language processing with a focus on domain specific capabilities. I also assist various startups in these areas.

My work has been published in IEEE Radar and AMIA, won national competitions and led to patent applications.
