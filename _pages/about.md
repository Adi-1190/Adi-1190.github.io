Hi! I'm Adi.

I'm a a machine learning Data Scientist at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://corporate.thermofisher.com/content/tfcorpsite/us/en/index/about.html). At Thermo, I focus on B2B recommender systems for ecommerce and global sales representatives. I have a broad range of interests ranging from experiment design, scaleable use cases of intelligent system (especially in agriculture) and natural language processing with a focus on domain specific capabilities. I also assist various startups in these areas.


Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
